	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genome assembly is typically a two-stage process: contig assembly followed by the use of paired sequencing reads to join contigs into scaffolds. Scaffolds are usually the focus of reported assembly statistics; longer scaffolds greatly facilitate the use of genome sequences in downstream analyses, and it is appealing to present larger numbers as metrics of assembly performance. However, scaffolds are highly prone to errors, especially when generated using short reads, which can directly result in inflated assembly statistics.
{RESULTS}: Here we provide the first independent evaluation of scaffolding tools for second-generation sequencing data. We find large variations in the quality of results depending on the tool and dataset used. Even extremely simple test cases of perfect input, constructed to elucidate the behaviour of each algorithm, produced some surprising results. We further dissect the performance of the scaffolders using real and simulated sequencing data derived from the genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Plasmodium falciparum and Homo sapiens. The results from simulated data are of high quality, with several of the tools producing perfect output. However, at least 10\% of joins remains unidentified when using real data.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The scaffolders vary in their usability, speed and number of correct and missed joins made between contigs. Results from real data highlight opportunities for further improvements of the tools. Overall, {SGA}, {SOPRA} and {SSPACE} generally outperform the other tools on our datasets. However, the quality of the results is highly dependent on the read mapper and genome complexity.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Completing the genome sequence of an organism is an important task in comparative, functional and structural genomics. However, this remains a challenging issue from both a computational and an experimental viewpoint. Genome scaffolding (i.e. the process of ordering and orientating contigs) of de novo assemblies usually represents the first step in most genome finishing pipelines.
{RESULTS}: In this paper, we present {MeDuSa} (Multi-Draft based Scaffolder), an algorithm for genome scaffolding. {MeDuSa} exploits information obtained from a set of (draft or closed) genomes from related organisms to determine the correct order and orientation of the contigs. {MeDuSa} formalises the scaffolding problem by means of a combinatorial optimisation formulation on graphs and implements an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm to solve it. In contrast to currently used scaffolders, it does not require either prior knowledge on the microrganisms dataset under analysis (e.g. their phylogenetic relationships) or the availability of paired end read libraries. This makes usability and running time two additional important features of our method. Moreover, benchmarks and tests on real bacterial datasets showed that {MeDuSa} is highly accurate and, in most cases, outperforms traditional scaffolders. The possibility to use {MeDuSa} on eukaryotic datasets has also been evaluated, leading to interesting results.
{AVAILABILITY}: {MeDuSa} web server: http://combo.dbe.unifi.it/medusa A stand-alone version of the software can be downloaded from https://github.com/combogenomics/medusa/releases. All results presented in this work have been obtained with {MeDuSa} v. 1.3.

	shorttitle = {{SCARPA}},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Scaffolding is the process of ordering and orienting contigs produced during genome assembly. Accurate scaffolding is essential for finishing draft assemblies, as it facilitates the costly and laborious procedures needed to fill in the gaps between contigs. Conventional formulations of the scaffolding problem are intractable, and most scaffolding programs rely on heuristic or approximate solutions, with potentially exponential running time.
{RESULTS}: We present {SCARPA}, a novel scaffolder, which combines fixed-parameter tractable and bounded algorithms with Linear Programming to produce near-optimal scaffolds. We test {SCARPA} on real datasets in addition to a simulated diploid genome and compare its performance with several state-of-the-art scaffolders. We show that {SCARPA} produces longer or similar length scaffolds that are highly accurate compared with other scaffolders. {SCARPA} is also capable of detecting misassembled contigs and reports them during scaffolding.
{AVAILABILITY}: {SCARPA} is open source and available from http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/scarpa.},
